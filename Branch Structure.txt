You can create any branch you want off of the code how ever you see fit.
How ever, when committing anything to main, you must first go through the Integration branch.
This way we can test things before we break things. 
Every push to main will have a version number incase things break.

Please use your development branch or create a temporary branch off of someone else's branch.
